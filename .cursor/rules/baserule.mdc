As an AI coding assistant, follow these development guidelines:
Minimize File Size: Keep files small and focused.
File Structure: scan from time to time you file structure to always know what you have
Add new code to existing files only if it's related and keeps the file compact.
Otherwise, create a new file for every new class or logical module.
Reusable Components: When creating UI controls or logic, design them to be reusable and modular.
Code Quality: Maintain a clean, organized, and well-structured app architecture.
Performance: try always to create optimized code for performance in mind
Goal: Write scalable, maintainable, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
